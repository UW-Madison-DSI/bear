# Backend for Embedded Academic Resources (BEAR)

## Note to self

1. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
1. Crawl data from OpenAlex with your institution: e.g., `uv run bear/crawler.py uw-madison`
1. Spin up a vector store backend (TBC). I want the speed of Milvus, but the convenient of PGVector...
1. Run ingest
1. Go to Minimalist Frontend
1. Maybe MCP
